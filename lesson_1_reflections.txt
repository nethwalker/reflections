Using diff make the process of finding differences between files much faster.

You can go back to earlier versions with better code, or find where mistakes were made when improving the code base.

What are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros: Improved logic of when to make commits.
Cons: Get out of the flow of writing code. May forget to commit changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because documents written in word processing software are usually not interrelated like coding files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log will show you each commit with a comment line.
git diff will compare two different files to show the differences between them so you can figure out exactly what changed.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
It allows you to go back to prior versions and figure out where the break occurred and what specific lines caused the breakage.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
My coding projects with Python in order to better document changes and have a more efficient and robust version control methodology.
