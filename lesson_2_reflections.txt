What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git creates a hidden .git folder with the metadata to store. This needs to be done to set up the git repository on the local machine.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It is a temporary area where you can add files but still make changes before finally commiting to git.
