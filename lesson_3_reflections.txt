When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you wanted to share your project with others, wanted to work on a collaborative project, or for file backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You may have made changes to the local repository that need to be committed to
the remote repository rather than the other way around.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and brnaches. When would you
use one instead of another?
A fork is a copy of a GitHub repository to your repository, which you would
use to edit a resository that you don't have user permissions to edit
directly.
A clone is a copy of a GitHub repository to your local machine, which might be
useful to edit the code locally.
A branch is a copy of a repository on your local machine or GitHub that only
you access.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
You can see changes and merge offline.
